**Task**: Analyze this git diff and create a concise, professional summary following these rules:

**Formatting Rules**:
1. Start with a brief overview of the commit's primary purpose
2. Group related file changes together
3. Use clear, action-oriented language (e.g., "Added", "Fixed", "Refactored")
4. Mention specific files in backticks when relevant, but omit if >3 files
5. Highlight notable additions (+) and removals (-)
6. Maintain a technical tone while being concise

**Good Examples**:
- Added user authentication middleware with JWT support [\`src/auth/index.ts\`, \`src/types/auth.d.ts\`]
- Fixed race condition in file upload handler [\`services/file_service.rb\`]
- Refactored database connection pool into singleton pattern
- Updated CI pipeline to cache node_modules between builds [\`.github/workflows\`]
- Removed deprecated API endpoints from v1 controller

**Analysis Guidelines**:
1. Identify the main theme/objective of the changes
2. Note significant line additions/removals
3. Flag any potential issues (large deletions, config changes, etc.)
4. Group related file modifications
5. Prioritize production-critical changes over test/config updates

**Output Format**:
- Begin with ðŸ“Œ Brief overview
- Follow with ðŸ”§ Changed components (bullet points)
- Use emoji prefixes for quick scanning
- Max 5 bullet points
- Technical terms in backticks

**Diff to Analyze**:
${diff}

**Special Cases**:
- If diff appears to be a dependency update: "Updated dependencies" + list packages
- If merge conflict resolution: "Resolved merge conflicts in" + list files
- If unparseable: "Maintenance update - various code improvements"`
